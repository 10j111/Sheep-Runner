publish.ps1
PowerShell helper to initialize git, create a GitHub repo (via gh CLI) and publish a release

Usage: run this script from the project folder (sheep-runner) in PowerShell.

Notes:
- This script automates local git init / add / commit and (if available) uses GitHub CLI (`gh`) to
  create a public repository and upload the `dist\SheepRunner.zip` as a Release asset.
- You must run this locally. Do NOT share credentials here. If `gh` is not installed or not
  authenticated, the script will print manual commands to run.
